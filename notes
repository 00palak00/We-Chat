web sockets => they solve the problem of http response
http requests are one way connection server cannot tell 
client to take requests only client can send server requests

hhtp long polling(google about it)

web socket ensure a two way connection between client and server
whenever either client or server have any request they send to each
other

just like http and https
there is ws and wss(secured one)

socket.io is a javaScript library for real time applications
it is a library that enables real time, bidirectional and event-
based communication between browser and server.
it consist of a nodejs server and 
a javascript library for the browser(which can also be run from nodejs)

event based =>there are events in nodejs. when ever we click on something
on a website we fire an event and inbrowser javaScript can listen to that event

server can emmit an event and client can listen to it and take action and vice versa

when ever a user1 build connection with socket.io then socket.io will emmit
event to all other users that user1 has joined chat

in http request we have to send requests to server(by refreshing page again and again) 
and ask if there is some update or not but in sockets.io it will itself send you the 
request when there is an update

there will be two servers 1st node server and 2nd a independent website that
will connect to the nodejs

scripts will get download in background and will run
once DOM is downloaded
